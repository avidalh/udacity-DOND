## Organizational Snapshot

#### Company description.

**April 26**

I work as backend/devops developer in a small company called **La Laguna Bike Center** that sells mainly mountainbikes and all related stuff. The company has a total of six retail stores in three different cities, as well as an online store. Our company has about 600 employees. The IT department is 80 people. My team of 12 people is part of the IT department and maintains the online storefront.

#### What is the core function of your team? What is the core function of your company or organizational unit? Is the core function of your team well aligned with the function of the larger organizational unit or the company as a whole?

**April 26**

* Team goal: Provide an online bike store for customers
* Organizational unit: Maintain web presence and IT infrastructure for company
* Company goal: sell good bikes and mtb products

#### Who are your team's customers? Are they internal or external? What do they need?

**April 26**

* External customer: users of the online store. They need to be able to buy mtb products.
* Internal customer: Accounting team. Need to receive daily totals of online purchase receipts.
* Internal customer: Warehouse team. Need to receive details of each transaction including exact bike model, size, and color sold, and also shipping address so the bike can be sent to the purchaser.
* Internal customer: Purchasing team needs summary report of bike styles sold each week for forecasting and restocking purposes.

#### What is the current flow of software development and delivery in your team? List the main steps and whether they are manual or automated. 

**April 26**

* Feature requests, bug reports, etc. are checked every Monday and project manager determines priorities for the week (manual)
* Code gets written based on priorities (manual)
* Software gets checked into codebase (manual)
* Once a week, normally wednesday afternoon, it gets deployed to a test server (manual) 
* QA team tests it and files bug reports or signs off as appropriate (manual) 
* Once a month codebase is sent to ops team for deployment into production (I don't know if it's automated or manual, but judging from ops usually staying late for the release days it's manual).

#### What are all the teams or people that are involved in a product release, from start to finish? 

**April 26**

* Project manager
* Marketing
* Design 
* Developers (my team)
* Testers, QA

#### How is communication handled in your organization? 

**April 28**

I think communication is not as good as we would have liked. I sometimes talk with other teams over lunch and usually find out a lot of interesting things that are even helpful at work.

# Quantitative Ratings

#### How satisfied are you with how other teams work and support the work that you do? (Scale: 1-10, 10 is best)

**April 28**

Rating: 5. 

#### Do deployments go smoothly? (Scale: 1-10, 10 is best)

**April 28**

Rating: 2. Well, most of the times everything works pretty well, however sometimes we have had major problems and all the system had to be down and rolled back to the previous version. It was a very uncomfortable situation.

#### Do you have planned downtime for system upgrades or maintenance? 

**April 28**

Yes, almost every month in the late night, in order to affect to a low number of users.

#### How much time does it take to set up the environment for a new project? 

**April 28**

About 3 days, if sysadmins are not busy with the new release or a week to ten days if they are busy.

#### How often do you deploy to production? 

**April 28**

* Currently: 1/month
* Ideally: maybe 2-3/week

#### How long does it take to deploy a new feature or bugfix from "code checked in to repository" to "feature is live to customers"? 

**April 28**

* Normal situations: 3 weeks
* In very busy periods: 4-5 weeks

#### How easy is it to deploy a new feature or bugfix from "code checked in to repository" to "feature is live to customers"? (Scale: 1-10, 10 is best) 

**April 28**

Rating: 3. It takes too long sometimes, even when the bug fix is done, to get on to the production servers because they have to be shut down and brought back up which is not acceptable for sales. 

#### How would you rate the quality of your software? (Scale: 1-10, 10 is best) 

**April 28**

Rating: 6. It's ok. We have a testing team with a good routine and a bugtracker with good rules for dealing with issues.

#### How easy it is to test your software? (Scale: 1-10, 10 is best)

**April 28**

Now - 4. The testing team is good about the routines but sometimes even when everything works in testing it is broken in production.


#### How satisfied are your customers? (Scale: 1-10, 10 is best)

**April 28**

Rating: 6. I think they are pretty satisfied. We have a feedback link on our site, and we follow what people say about us in social media.
